# Covid-Analysis




## Overview
This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data using Tableau and MySQL. It aims to provide valuable insights into the relationship between vaccination rates and COVID-19 mortality.

## Project Description
This project involves collecting, cleaning, and analyzing COVID-19 data related to deaths and vaccinations. The primary objectives include:

- Examining the correlation between vaccination rates and COVID-19 mortality.
- Identifying geographical areas with higher mortality rates.
- Creating interactive and informative visualizations using Tableau.

## Data Sources
- COVID-19 mortality data: [Link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
- Vaccination data: [Link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

## Analysis Tools
- Tableau: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- MySQL: Employed for data storage, retrieval, and cleaning.

## Data Preparation
Before analysis, data preparation was performed using MySQLâ€”this involved cleaning, joining, and aggregating data to create a usable dataset for analysis.

Refer to the SQL scripts for detailed steps.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis was conducted using Tableau. Various visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, were created to explore patterns and trends in the COVID-19 data.

## Visualization
Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the project's findings.

## Results
The results of this analysis are summarized in the Tableau workbook and can be accessed through the interactive dashboards.
